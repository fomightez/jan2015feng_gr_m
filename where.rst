============================

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `Enthought's Canopy Python disctributiona and Analysis
   Environment <https://www.enthought.com/products/epd/>`__\ \*

   PC <https://software.rc.fas.harvard.edu/training/scraping/install/>`__\ \*

-  `Sublime Text on a Mac <http://www.sublimetext.com/>`__\ \* - there
   is a way to run code when you are in Sublime Text, see
   `here <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8551735/how-do-i-run-python-code-from-sublime-text-2>`__.
   Supposedly, it can be done on Windows too if you deal with setting
   the path.
