Python for today
================

Getting started, we’ll use Sourcelair and Sagemath Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`SourceLair`_\ \*

`Guide to Python on Sourcelair`_

`Sagemath Cloud`_ enables cloud-based IPython notebook work. An
introduction can be found [here](

Sagemath Cloud use is for the IPython Notebook ability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`SourceLair`_, although cloud-based, is like traditional computing
interfaces for Python and many languages.

We will come back to that.

   (Skip to the three-minute mark since we aren’t necessarily interested
   in running it on Amazon web services right now.) A non-interactive
   version of the notebook he demonstrates is `here`_.

Using Sourcelair to run Python Interactively
============================================

We will begin to cover

-  Basics of Python ( TO BE DONE Link to an ipynb with examples in it
   already)

   -  variable types

      -  strings
      -  integers
      -  floats
      -  booleans

   -  lists and dictionaries

   -  slicing strings and indexing items in lists

   -  math and comparative operators

   -  conditionals (Slide of comparison from PCfB book, pg. 116)

      -  if
      -  if-else

   -  loops (Slide of comparison from PCfB book, pg. 117)

      -  for
      -  while

   -  type conversion

   -  functions

   \*file and string handling

*We’ll break it up with some real world examples*
