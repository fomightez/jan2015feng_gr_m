    "Graduate students who can incorporate programming into research
    will have their pick of postdoc positions and other offers, says
    Schloss. Such skills — or access to people who have them — are
    increasingly necessary for the big-data questions that scientists
    want to pursue. “If they think they have a lot of data now, in ten
    years we are only going to have more,” he says. “If they don't
    figure it out now, it's just going to get worse."

   the important thing is you use it and stick with it, even if you
   prgress slowly.

Learning Python

-  `Scipy Lecture Notes: One document to learn numerics, science, and
   data with Python <http://www.scipy-lectures.org/>`__

-  The three Coursera courses in Rice University's Fundamentals of
   Computing specialization. The three courses are `An Introduction to
   Interactive Programming in
   Python <https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython>`__,
   `Principles of
   Computing <https://www.coursera.org/course/principlescomputing>`__,
   and `Algorithmic
   Thinking <https://www.coursera.org/course/algorithmicthink>`__ By the
   third you are learning little to no new Python and focusing on
   designing and writing efficient algorithmns, which is useful too. One
   of the instructors, Luay Nakhleh, focuses on bioinformatics, and so
   while they touch on some of these aspects later in the series of
   courses, the main emphasis is computing in general.
