Going forward
=============

Look into
---------

-  `Practical Computing for Biologists book by Haddock and
   Dunn <http://practicalcomputing.org/>`__

-  `April 2013 Software Carpentry at
   Arizona <http://2013-swc-az.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`__

-  `Bioinf-py <http://hplgit.github.io/bioinf-py/doc/pub/html/index.html>`__
   At the `main site you can select your
   form <http://hplgit.github.io/bioinf-py/doc/web/index.html>`__.

-  `a two year-old screencast intro of IPython notebook by Titus
   Brown <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaS4NXxL5Qc&feature=youtu.be>`__
   (Skip to the three-minute mark since we aren't necessarily interested
   in running it on Amazon web services right now.) A non-interactive
   version of the notebook he demonstrates is
   `here <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/fomightez/jan2015feng_gr_m/blob/master/others_demos/titus_screencast.ipynb>`__.

Learning Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `A hands-on introduction to Python for beginning
   programmers <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkx5_MRAV3A>`__

-  `Rosalind, platform for learning bioinformatics and programming
   through problem solving <http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/>`__

-  `A modern guide to getting started with Data Science and
   Python <http://twiecki.github.io/blog/2014/11/18/python-for-data-science/>`__

-  `How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python
   2.x <http://www.openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english2e/>`__

-  `How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python
   3.x <http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/index.html>`__

-  `Bioinf-py <http://hplgit.github.io/bioinf-py/doc/web/index.html>`__

-  The three Coursera courses in Rice University's Fundamentals of
   Computing specialization. The three courses are `An Introduction to
   Interactive Programming in
   Python <https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython>`__,
   `Principles of
   Computing <https://www.coursera.org/course/principlescomputing>`__,
   and `Algorithmic
   Thinking <https://www.coursera.org/course/algorithmicthink>`__ By the
   third you are learning little to no new Python and focusing on
   designing and writing efficient algorithmns, which is useful too. One
   of the instructors, Luay Nakhleh, focuses on bioinformatics, and so
   while they touch on some of these aspects later in the series of
   courses, the main emphasis is computing in general.

-  Coursera course: `Programming for Everybody
   (Python) <https://www.coursera.org/course/pythonlearn>`__ - Gradually
   paced introduction to coding essentials using Python

   Workshops <http://ged.msu.edu/angus/>`__, most recent is `Next-Gen
   Sequence Analysis Workshop

   interesting condensed course he taught last year called `2013
   Zero-Entry Workshop: Computational Science for
   Biologists <http://2013-uw-zero-entry.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__.
