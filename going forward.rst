Going forward
=============

Look into
---------

-  `Practical Computing for Biologists book by Haddock and Dunn`_

-  `April 2013 Software Carpentry at Arizona`_

-  `Bioinf-py`_

-  `a two year-old screencast intro of IPython notebook by Titus Brown`_
   (Skip to the three-minute mark since we aren’t necessarily interested
   in running it on Amazon web services right now.) A non-interactive
   version of the notebook he demonstrates is `here`_.

Learning Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `A hands-on introduction to Python for beginning programmers`_

-  [The GOBLET Training Portal: A Global Repository of Bioinformatics
   Training Materials, Courses and Trainers]
   (http://mygoblet.org/training-portal), see `abstract of associated
   publication`_

-  `A modern guide to getting started with Data Science and Python`_

-  `How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python 2.x`_

-  `How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python 3.x`_

-  `Bioinf-py`_

-  Coursera course: `Programming for Everybody (Python)`_ - Gradually
   paced introduction to coding essentials using Python

-  `Dive Into Python`_

-  `Bioinformatics and Genomics: IPython and the Systems Biology
   Knowledgebase`_

-  `The Python Tutorial`_

-  `Python for Biologists`_

NGS Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `Titus Brown and Colleagues’ Next-Gen Sequence Analysis Workshops`_,
   most recent is [Next-Gen Sequence Analysis Workshop
   (2014)(http://angus.readthedocs.org/en/2014/) *I printed this out.*
   It also has an interesting condensed course he taught last year
   called [2013 Zero-Entry Workshop: Computational Science for
   Biologists] (http://2013-uw-zero-entry.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
