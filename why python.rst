Where to code and run Python
============================

On Your Desktop - Asterisks indicates those in this section I have used and they are in order of preference/familiarty in this particular section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `Enthought’s Canopy Python disctributiona and Analysis
   Environment`_\ \*

-  `Anaconda`_ is now the suggested source for scientific Python by
   Software Carpentry.

-  `IDLE on Windows PC`_\ \*

-  `Sublime Text on a Mac`_\ \* - there is a way to run code when you
   are in Sublime Text, see `here`_. Supposedly, it can be done on
   Windows too if you deal with setting the path.

-  `Editing\ *and*\ Running\ *a*\ Python\ *Program*\ With\ *TextWrangler*\ on\ *a*\ Macintosh`_\ \*

-  Terminal on Mac\*

In Your Browser/Cloud - Asterisks indicates those in this section I have used
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `PythonAnywhere`_\ \*

-  `SourceLair`_\ \*

-  `Sagemath Cloud`_ enables cloud-based IPython notebook work. An
   introduction can be found
   `here <http://www.randalolson.com/2013/11/02/sagemath-cloud-makes-collaborating-with-ipython-notebooks-easier-than-ever/>`__

-  `Domino Data Lab`_\ \* - Unfortunately, the IPython notebook aspect
   doesn’t seem to work when on Upstate’s network, but you can still use
   Python there.

-  `Wakari.io - Web-based Python Data Analysis`_\ \* - Unfortunately,
   the IPython notebook aspect doesn’t seem to work when on Upstate’s
   network, but you can still use Python there.

-  `ScienceBox`_ - lacks free version as far as I know. All above have
   one.

-  Amazon Web Services\*- has a free low level one for first year. All
   above ScienceBox have free version.

-  DigitalOcean - lacks free version as far as I know. All above
   ScienceBox have free version.

-  Heroku - lacks free version as far as I know. All above ScienceBox
   have free version.

-  Rackspace - lacks free version as far as I know. All above ScienceBox
   have free version.

-  Google App Engine - I am unsure of cost here. `Try Google Cloud
   Platform free for 60 days`_

In Your Browser - Emulators (you won’t know it isn’t REALLY full-featured Python, for the most part)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `CodeSkulptor`_\ \*

-  `tutorialspoint`_\ \*- Hit ‘Try it’ on code sample to open window
   where you can edit and test any code!

-  `repl.it`_
